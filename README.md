# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

## 🔰 Internship Info
- **Program**: Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship
- **Duration**: June–July 2025
- **Week**: 1 (30% Progress Submission)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that can classify images of garbage into categories such as metal, paper, plastic, etc., to support automatic waste segregation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Apply transfer learning using a pre-trained model
- Evaluate accuracy and performance
- Submit GitHub repo link for Week 1

## 🔧 Work Summary (Week 1)
- ✅ Mentor-provided code was studied and reused
- ✅ Comments and structure added for clarity
- ✅ Model structure defined using Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNetV2)
- ✅ Future improvements planned (data augmentation, tuning)

## 🗃️ Dataset
Dataset was provided during the internship via LMS in ZIP format and used in Google Colab.

## 📌 How to Run
1. Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Upload and extract the dataset
3. Run each code cell sequentially

## ✅ Status
- [x] Notebook structured and improved
- [x] GitHub repo ready
- [ ] Dataset preprocessing (Planned – Week 2)
